## Powers of TAU

The ptau file was downloaded from  Hermez Protocol Ceremony from their dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mn47gnepqu88mzl/AACaJkBU7mmCq8uU8ml0-0fma?dl=0)

These are all named powersOfTau28_hez_final_*.ptau where the * is some number. This number indicates the number of constraints (2^x) that can exist in your circuits.

I used powersOfTau28_hez_final_15.ptau
